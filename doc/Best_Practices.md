# Principles, Patterns, and Concepts of Software Engineering (v3.1)

This document codifies an evolving canon of engineering rules, patterns, and best practicesâ€”now enriched with ten targeted enforcement enhancements per domain (Aâ€“J). Every rule subsumes explicit enforcement steps, self-check criteria, and severity classifications. Compliance is mandatory for building secure, maintainable, and high-quality systems.

|---------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CCP-001 | DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)    | Single source of truth for every concept or logic.            | Static analysis; duplicate-finder reports.    |
| CCP-002 | KISS                             | Prefer the simplest solution that meets requirements.         | Code reviews reject unneeded abstractions.    |
